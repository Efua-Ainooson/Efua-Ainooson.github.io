    "text": "Iâ€™m Efua Ainooson Noonoo, a graduate student in Statistics at Oregon State University with a background in Actuarial Science from the University of Ghana. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to ask better questions and uncover insights that can transform healthcare, finance, and the way we understand human outcomes.\n\n\nMy interest in numbers has never been about formulas or precision for their own sake. What drew me inâ€”and still doesâ€”is their ability to reveal structure in complexity, to bring clarity where there was once only noise. That curiosity has grown into a commitment to applying statistical thinking to real-world problems across domainsâ€”whether in genomics and medical research, survival analysis, financial modeling, or complex data analysis across disciplines.\n\n\nIâ€™m especially interested in the interplay between theory and computation. At the core of it all is a drive to use statistics not just to model data, but to generate insight that matters.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I Work On\n\n\nTranslating Data Into Discovery\n\n\nI specialize in statistical learning and modeling for data, with a focus on applications in health, finance, and policy. My work spans topics like survival analysis with dependent censoring, penalized regression methods, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning techniques including decision trees and clustering. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to projects where traditional techniques fall shortâ€”where modeling complexity and interpretability matter equally.\n\n\nRecent Projects\n\n\n\nGenomics Research: Performed differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq data to investigate dietary lipid effects in juvenile Chinook salmon.\n\n\nSurvival Simulation Study: Evaluated IPCW, naive models, and selection/pattern mixture models under dependent censoring.\n\n\nLeukemia Gene Expression Classification: Used LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net to assess stability and predictive power in high-dimensional genomic data.\n\n\nLoan Default Risk Optimization: Combined logistic regression with optimization algorithms to determine optimal interest rates based on predicted risk.\n\n\nBayesian Analysis of Life Expectancy: Compared Bayesian models to investigate links between lifestyle factors and longevity across major cities.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Forecasting: Applied time series methods in R to predict trends in pharmaceutical sales and demand.\n\n\nMicrofinance Strategy Modeling: Estimated optimal interest rates and punishment phases for borrowers in a microfinance institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nTools & Techniques\n\n\nIâ€™m proficient in R, Python, SQL, and Tableau, with additional experience in SAS, C++, Power BI, and Excel VBA. My technical and analytical skill set spans the following areas:\n\n\n\nStatistical Modeling & Inference\n\n\nBayesian Analysis\n\n\nTime Series & Forecasting\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nData Engineering & Visualization\n\n\nBioinformatics & Genomics\n\n\nResearch Computing\n\n\n\nMy work bridges statistical theory and practical application, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world impact. Iâ€™m continually expanding my toolkit to meet the challenges of interdisciplinary research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\n\n\nIâ€™m excited to continue working at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and real-world impactâ€”whether through research, data science, or analytics roles. In the near term, Iâ€™m seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my skills in biostatistics, financial modeling, and data analysis to complex challenges in healthcare, finance, and beyond.\n\n\nIâ€™m particularly interested in using statistical learning and machine learning techniques to support evidence-driven decision-making across disciplines. Whether itâ€™s improving patient outcomes, optimizing loan pricing, or analyzing policy impact, Iâ€™m drawn to problems where data meets decisions.\n\n\nLong-term, I aim to contribute to interdisciplinary research and analytics that combine methodological rigor with practical relevance.\n\n\nIf youâ€™re interested in connecting about research, analytics roles, or collaborative projects, feel free to reach out."

    "text": "ðŸŒ¸ Hey there!\nIâ€™m Efua Ainooson. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Iâ€™m a statistics enthusiast, a data storyteller, and a firm believer that good models (both statistical and fashion-related) make life better. Iâ€™m a graduate student in statistics. I love the thrill of solving complex problems, the beauty of a well-structured dataset, and the satisfaction of turning numbers into insights that actually matter.\nOutside of work, Iâ€™m a curious learner, a fan of deep conversations, and a lover of beautiful, clean designs (because why shouldnâ€™t data look good too?). Oh, and I absolutely love discovering creative ways to blend statistics, machine learning, and storytelling.\nSo go aheadâ€”poke around, check out my work, and letâ€™s chat about all things stats, data, and life!"
