I‚Äôm a statistics enthusiast, a data storyteller, and a firm believer that good models (both statistical and fashion-related) make life better. I‚Äôm a graduate student in statistics. I love the thrill of solving complex problems, the beauty of a well-structured dataset, and the satisfaction of turning numbers into insights that actually matter.\nOutside of work, I‚Äôm a curious learner, a fan of deep conversations, and a lover of beautiful, clean designs (because why shouldn‚Äôt data look good too?). Oh, and I absolutely love discovering creative ways to blend statistics, machine learning, and storytelling.\nSo go ahead‚Äîpoke around, check out my work, and let‚Äôs chat about all things stats, data, and life!"
