I’m a statistics enthusiast, a data storyteller, and a firm believer that good models (both statistical and fashion-related) make life better. I’m a graduate student in statistics. I love the thrill of solving complex problems, the beauty of a well-structured dataset, and the satisfaction of turning numbers into insights that actually matter.\nOutside of work, I’m a curious learner, a fan of deep conversations, and a lover of beautiful, clean designs (because why shouldn’t data look good too?). Oh, and I absolutely love discovering creative ways to blend statistics, machine learning, and storytelling.\nSo go ahead—poke around, check out my work, and let’s chat about all things stats, data, and life!"
