    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The primary objective of this project is to analyze a leukemia gene expression dataset using various penalized regression methods.
      The analysis applies <strong>Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net</strong> to identify the most significant genes associated with leukemia and to develop robust logistic regression models for classifying leukemia subtypes.

    <h2>Estimation of Lending Phase & Interest Rate in Microfinance</h2>
    <img src="Microfinance.jpg" alt="Interest Rate Study">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The study calculates the <strong>optimal interest rate</strong> and <strong>lending phase duration</strong> to ensure financial sustainability and prevent strategic borrower defaults.<br><br>
      A low interest rate results in microfinance institutions running at a loss, while a high interest rate leads to borrower defaults. This research helps strike the perfect balance.
