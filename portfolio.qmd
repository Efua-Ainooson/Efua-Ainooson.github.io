## Handling Dependent Censoring in Survival Models: A Comparative Simulation Study

![](survival analysis image.jpg)

### Project Overview

This simulation-based project compares time-to-event models under dependent censoring using IPCW, naive models, and likelihood-based selection/pattern mixture models—highlighting performance in terms of bias, variance, and robustness.

## Evaluating Methods for Handling Dependent Censoring as a Missing Data Problem

![](missing data image.png)

### Project Overview

This project reframes dependent censoring as a missing not at random (MNAR) problem in survival analysis. I compared four approaches—IPCW, naive analysis, selection models, and pattern mixture models—under various dependence structures, evaluating their performance on bias and robustness.
