### **Project Overview**  
The primary objective of this project is to analyze a leukemia gene expression dataset using various penalized regression methods. The analysis applies **Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net** to identify the most significant genes associated with leukemia and to develop robust logistic regression models for classifying leukemia subtypes.
