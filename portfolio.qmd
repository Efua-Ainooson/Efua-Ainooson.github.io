  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The primary objective of this project is to analyze a leukemia gene expression dataset using various penalized regression methods. The analysis applies 
    <strong>Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net</strong> to identify the most significant genes associated with leukemia and to develop robust logistic regression models for classifying leukemia subtypes.

  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of the study is to calculate the duration of the lending phase and the optimal interest rate when taking a loan. A low interest rate could lead to financial losses for microfinance institutions, while a high interest rate may result in strategic borrower defaults.  
    <br><br>
    This study estimates the **optimal interest rate** and **suitable punishment phase duration** to ensure both the sustainability of the institution and the repayment incentives for borrowers.
