<div class="about-container">

  <p>
    I’m Efua Ainooson Noonoo, a graduate student in Statistics at Oregon State University with a background in Actuarial Science from the University of Ghana. I’m passionate about using data to ask better questions and uncover insights that can transform healthcare, finance, and the way we understand human outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interest in numbers has never been about formulas or precision for their own sake. What drew me in—and still does—is their ability to reveal structure in complexity, to bring clarity where there was once only noise. That curiosity has grown into a commitment to applying statistical thinking to real-world problems across domains—whether in genomics and medical research, survival analysis, financial modeling, or or complex data analysis across disciplines.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m especially interested in the interplay between theory and computation. At the core of it all is a drive to use statistics not just to model data, but to generate insight that matters.

  <h2>What I Work On</h2>

  <h3>Translating Data Into Discovery</h3>
  <p>
    I specialize in statistical learning and modeling for data, with a focus on applications in health, finance, and policy. My work spans topics like survival analysis with dependent censoring, penalized regression methods, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning techniques including decision trees and clustering. I’m particularly drawn to projects where traditional techniques fall short—where modeling complexity and interpretability matter equally.
  </p>

  <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Genomics Research:</strong> Performed differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq data to investigate dietary lipid effects in juvenile Chinook salmon.</li>
    <li><strong>Survival Simulation Study:</strong> Evaluated IPCW, naive models, and selection/pattern mixture models under dependent censoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Leukemia Gene Expression Classification:</strong> Used LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net to assess stability and predictive power in high-dimensional genomic data.</li>
    <li><strong>Loan Default Risk Optimization:</strong> Combined logistic regression with optimization algorithms to determine optimal interest rates based on predicted risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Bayesian Analysis of Life Expectancy:</strong> Compared Bayesian models to investigate links between lifestyle factors and longevity across major cities.</li>
    <li><strong>Pharmaceutical Forecasting:</strong> Applied time series methods in R to predict trends in pharmaceutical sales and demand.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Estimated optimal interest rates and punishment phases for borrowers in microfinance institution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

  <p>
    I’m excited to continue working at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and real-world impact; whether through research, data science, or analytics roles. In the near term, I’m seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my skills in biostatistics, financial modeling, and data analysis to complex challenges in healthcare, finance, and beyond.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m particularly interested in using statistical learning and machine learning techniques to support evidence-driven decision-making across disciplines. Whether it’s improving patient outcomes, optimizing loan pricing, or analyzing policy impact, I’m drawn to problems where data meets decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long-term, I aim to contribute to interdisciplinary research and analytics that combine methodological rigor with practical relevance.
